= Verification resources

This section outlines the resources which are utilized for conducting of the verification activities.

The main resources are:

1. GitLab Runner
2. GitHub Actions

These resources offer the necessary infrastructure and automation capabilities to execute the verification activities effectively. The use of a self-hosted GitLab Runner and GitHub Actions ensures reliable and controlled environments for conducting the tests and analyzing the results.

== GitLab Runner

The ETL components and system testing utilize a self-hosted GitLab Runner for test execution.
The self-hosted GitLab Runner provides a dedicated environment for running tests and ensures consistent and controlled testing conditions.
The configuration and management of the GitLab Runner are handled internally by the project team.

== GitHub Actions

Some testing activities make use of GitHub Actions for test execution.
GitHub Actions provide an automated workflow and testing environment for running tests on the server.
The GitHub Actions workflow is configured and maintained within the project's GitHub repository.
