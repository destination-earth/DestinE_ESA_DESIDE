Polar View is the prime contractor and responsible for the overall
execution of the proposed activity. The team members and their roles are
as follows:

-   Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) – Coordination of decision
    support information for Greenland waters (Baffin Bay, Labrador Sea,
    Greenland Sea)

A critical aspect of the proposed work scope is the active and effective
engagement of end-users concerned with polar and Baltic Sea operations.
To this end, an end-user representative group has been established to
provide advice to the technical team, articulate end-user information
requirements, and review agile development output. The members of the
end-user representative group are:

-   International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG)
-   Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency
-   Ponant
-   Alfred Wegener Institute
-   Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)

Polar View has assigned David Arthurs as the Project Manager to lead the
proposed activity. The Project Manager will report to the Technical
Officer assigned by RHEA on all aspects related to the planning and
execution of the project. Where required, the Project Manager will
interface with other contact points at RHEA and ESA. The Project Manager
is supported by the Software and End-User Leads, Stephan Meißl and Lasse
Rabenstein respectively. Each Lead will be responsible for all related
tasks and deliverables and will interface as required with all task
contributors.
