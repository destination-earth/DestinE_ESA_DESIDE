|UCD
|REQ01
|3.2., 3.3., & 3.4.
|Interactive dashboard
|DESIDE shall provide an online dashboard allowing users to interactively explore processed, integrated and combined dataset for the various covered regions and projections. Within the interactive dashboard users shall be able to compare historical sea ice indicators with future projections in order to establish a trust in future projections based on historical performance.
|P, more data and analysis features are added in the Polar dashboard.

|UCD
|REQ02
|3.2., 3.3., & 3.4.
|Data access
|Access to sea ice data including ice movement observations using both buoys and radars as well as forecasts of sea-ice movement and compression, and volume and deformation characteristics of sea ice shall be demonstrated and provided.
|P, a first draft Jupyter notebook showing data access is available. More data needs to be made accessible through DESP platfrom and access demonstrated in the notebook.

|UCD
|REQ03
|3.4.
|Data transfer between IcySea and Polar TEP
|The exchanging and sending of data between Polar TEP and IcySea application for display and analysis in both platforms shall be supported.
|P, in development. First data examples are shown in the polar dashboard.

|UCD
|REQ04
