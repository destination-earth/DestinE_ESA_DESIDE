|Goal
a| To provide an integrated dataset combining sea ice climate indicators based on observations (e.g. EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice SAF) and climate model projections. 
Accompanying this will be a web service allowing users to interactively play with various projections.
The combination of observed and projected indicators will help establish trust in projections.
This web service can be integrated in AMAP defined dashboards which they are developing.

|Actors
a| 
* AMAP secretariat (Pan-Arctic and regional levels)
* Norwegian Directorate for Environment (is interested in the regions in the European part of the Arctic)
* DESIDE sea ice climate experts
* DESIDE service development expert

|Pre-conditions
a|
. EUMETSAT Sea Ice SAF Sea Ice Climate Products (https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/sea-ice-products OSI-430-a, OSI-450-a, OSI-455, OSI-458) available in DEDL/DESP.
. EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice SAF Sea Ice Index (https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/sea-ice-products OSI-420) available in DEDL/DESP.
. Selected IPCC CMIP model sea ice output is available in DEDL/DESP for processing into indicators.
. MET sea ice indicator visualisation tool is available (e.g. https://cryo.met.no/en/sea-ice-index-monthly, daily and monthly setup exist today) for integration in dashboard of choice of the stakeholder.

|Post-conditions
a| 
. An integrated/combined dataset of sea ice climate indicators based on observations and model simulations.
. The above mentioned dataset available in the sea ice indicator tool mentioned above, available for integration in user defined dashboards.

|Normal flow
a| 
. The visualisation tool is launched.
. Within the visualisation tool the user can compare historical (based on observations) sea ice indicators with future projections (based on carefully selected climate model scenarios) in order to establish a trust in future projections based on historical performance.

|Notes and issues
a| 
. This use case is based on previous elaborations through the SUDARCO project focusing on trustworthy climate projections for 2050 in the Gakkel ridge area in the Arctic Ocean.
. The sea ice climate experts have to define which climate models that are trustworthy concerning sea ice projections in the areas of interest.
