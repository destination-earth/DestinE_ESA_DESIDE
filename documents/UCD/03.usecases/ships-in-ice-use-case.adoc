|Goal
a| Provide navigation-relevant, high temporal and spatial resolution sea ice information products to ice going ships. The data needs to be delivered in an easy-to-use user-friendly way which provides interpretation help and allows for easy decision-making even without expert sea ice knowledge. Due to the dynamic nature of moving sea ice, forecasts of the variable conditions are oftentimes mission-critical as well. 
Account for user-specific ice information needs:

* Research ship data support:
- for long transits (strategic planning)
- very short term tactical navigation to fulfill research goals
- high update frequency
* Expedition Cruise ship data support:
- for long transits
- tactical planning
- data handling as easy as possible
  (crews with limited scientific background)

|Actors
a| 
* Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (Research Institute operating the Icebreaker Polarstern)
* Ponant (Expedition Cruise Operator)
* Various other partners of Drift+Noise that havenâ€™t been mentioned in the proposal specifically
* DESIDE software development experts
* DESIDE ice consultant (Drift+Noise)

|Pre-conditions
a| The following data sets need to be available via the DESIDE platforms:

* RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR imagery (https://www.eodms-sgdot.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/)
* Sentinel-1 (ESA) SAR imagery (https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/)
* Sea ice and met-ocean data (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_002_001/description; https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description; https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024/description; https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_001_027/description; https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/WIND_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_012_004/description)
* Sea ice charts from national ice services:
- DMI: https://download.dmi.dk/public/ICESERVICE/
- US NIC, weekly charts: https://usicecenter.gov/Products
- US NWS, daily charts Alaska: https://portal.aoos.org/?ls=CGOnN2L_#map
- Canadian Ice Service, daily charts
- Canadian Ice Service, weekly charts
- AARI (not sure about this one): http://ice.aari.aq
- Norway (we only have access to the newest zip file): https://cryo.met.no/sites/cryo/files/latest/NIS_arctic_latest_pl_a.zip
- Argentinian Hydrographic Institute, weekly charts (twice a week): https://www.hidro.gob.ar/Smara/glacio/sglaciologica_ing.asp?op=2

|Post-conditions
a| 
* Added value data analysis (image warping, Harshness Index, Structure Icing, POLARIS Risk, Image Interpretation)
* Include above-mentioned data set into the DESIDE platforms: Dashboard, PolarTEP
* Include RCM and ice charts in IcySea

|Normal flow
a| 
* Provide users with preliminary access to the various DESIDE platforms

|Notes and issues
a| 
* Define areas of interest:
- AWI: Arctic-wide
- Ponant: special interest in data for the journey to the North Pole
