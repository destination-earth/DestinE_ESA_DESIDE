|Goal
a| Provide navigation-relevant, high temporal and spatial resolution sea ice information products to ice going ships. The data needs to be delivered in an easy-to-use user-friendly way which provides interpretation help and allows for easy decision-making even without expert sea ice knowledge. Due to the dynamic nature of moving sea ice, forecasts of the variable conditions are oftentimes mission-critical as well. 
Account for user-specific ice information needs:

* Research ship data support:
- for long transits (strategic planning)
- very short term tactical navigation to fulfill research goals
- high update frequency
* Expedition Cruise ship data support:
- for long transits
- tactical planning
- data handling as easy as possible
  (crews with limited scientific background)

|Actors
a| 
* Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (Research Institute operating the Icebreaker Polarstern)
* Ponant (Expedition Cruise Operator)
* Various other partners of Drift+Noise that havenâ€™t been mentioned in the proposal specifically
* DESIDE software development experts
* DESIDE ice consultant (Drift+Noise)

|Pre-conditions
a| The following data sets need to be available via the DESP platform:
* RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR imagery (https://www.eodms-sgdot.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/)
* Sentinel-1 (ESA) SAR imagery (https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/)
* Sea ice drift forecast data (TOPAZ5, neXtSIM)(https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_002_001/description and https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description)
* ICON wind forecast data (https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/nwp/icon/grib/)
* Sea ice charts from all the national ice services:
. DMI: https://download.dmi.dk/public/ICESERVICE/
. US NIC: https://usicecenter.gov/Products
. AARI (not sure about this one): http://ice.aari.aq
. Norway (we only have access to the newest zip file): https://cryo.met.no/sites/cryo/files/latest/NIS_arctic_latest_pl_a.zip 


|Post-conditions
a| 
. Added value data sets (morphed images)
. Create intermediate data sets (drift forecast trajectories) 
. Validate morphed images based on ship data/feedback
. Include above-mentioned data set into the various DESIDE platforms e.g. PolarTEP
. Include RCM and ice charts in IcySea


|Normal flow
a| 
. Provide users with preliminary access to the various DESIDE platforms
. Collect their feedback
. Implement feedback


|Notes and issues
a| 
* Implementation into IcySea (contract issue), IcySea code won't be shared
* Define areas of interest:
- AWI: Arctic-wide
- Ponant: special interest in data for the journey to the North Pole
* Connect local ship data with image processor
