|Goal
a| 
Provide sea ice information for the Baltic Sea icebreaker management by Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (FTIA). The needed sea ice information includes sea ice concentration, thickness, and movement.

|Actors
a| 
* Finnish Meteorological Institute
* Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency
* DESIDE software development experts
* DESIDE service development expert

|Pre-conditions
a|
The following data sets need to be available via the DESP platform:
* SAR images
* Sea ice drift and forecasted ice drift from Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS).
* Sea ice concentration and thickness from CMEMS

|Post-conditions
a| 
Combined datasets of sea ice information based on satellite observations and model simulations made available.
Include datasets into the various DESIDE platforms e.g. Polar Dashboard, Polar TEP, IcySea

|Normal flow
a| 
Provide FTIA with access to a selected DESIDE platform.

|Notes and issues

|===

The Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (FTIA) has the responsibility for arranging icebreaking services 
to Finnish winter ports. The agency procures icebreaking services from service providers. Furthermore, FTIA sets 
assistance restrictions to Finnish ports and coordinates the use of icebreaking resources. FTIA acts in 
close coordination with the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) regarding icebreaking in the Gulf of Bothnia.

Currently FTIA uses FMI's ice charts and forecasts as well as the HELMI SEA-ice model and the satellite and 
ice radar images. From their viewpoint the most interesting developments to products would be a better coverage 
for ice movement observations using both buoys and radars as well as forecasts of sea-ice movement and compression. 
In addition, information concerning the volume and deformation characteristics of sea ice, if possible divided by
the sea area, are important.

The FTIA and SMA have jointly developed an icebreaker management and information sharing system where ice and 
weather data it utilized by winter navigation authorities, icebreakers, and other winter navigation operators. 
Any services that can be used via the IBNet-system, would provide the most added value to FTIA. Ilmanet is also
a valuable resource.
