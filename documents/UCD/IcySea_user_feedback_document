END USER FEEDBACK::
In the framework of DESIDE various new data layers have been implemented in IcySea. 
This document gathers the feedback we have received from users of these new data layers.
The '+' indicates positive feedback regarding the specific layer, while '-' indicates wishes and needs that haven't been met yet.

RCM radar satellite imagery in IcySea:
+ Extra coverage of RCM complements S1 coverage very well
   + Regions that S1 doesn't cover are covered now, especially the central Arctic (north of 81Â°N)
+ Much better temporal coverage (daily updates sometimes even more frequent depending on where users operate).
+ Faster processing times (images are available within one hour after satellite acquisition) increase usability significantly.
   + high update frequency allows for easier comparison between sat image and ice radar - increases situational awareness

- Regional differences in data availability (CSA issue)
- Access to original image information needed (source and acquisition time) - needed for reporting, especially in Canadian waters


Satellite image layer (in general):
- Increasing demand for shifted images to bridge gaps between consecutive images
- Access to older images, e.g. the most recent image, but also all images from the previous 3 to 10 days
- Difficulties with the interpretation of satellite (especially radar images) images --> AI-driven automated ice charts
   > addition of new DMI classification product (Copernicus, November 2024)


Ice Charts:
+ Representation of the ice charts in IcySea is very user-friendly and intuitive
   + direct POLARIS calculation is valuable (no need for manual calculations on the ship)
   - POLARIS calculation is only possible for limited selection of ice classes
   - Egg Code windows for multiple polygons at the same time

- More official ice chart products needed - highest demand for daily Canadian ice charts!
- AIRSS risk assessment needed as well, especially for older ships and in Canadian waters (crews need it for their reporting)


Additional data products wanted:
> Sea ice thickness
> High resolution sea ice classification (floe-size level)
> Iceberg products
> Historical data (monthly averages, long-term mean ice edge)
> Optical Sentinel-2 imagery


Additional features wanted in IcySea:
> more nautical tools (bearing, distances, courses, etc)
> Automated reporting along routes in IcySea (specifically Canadian waters)
> Drag and Drop of external satellite data into IcySea
